CHAPTER XV

QUINTANIS 1 was a municipality of Raetia Secunda,2
situated on the bank of the Danube. N ear by on the
other side ran a small river named Businca. Often the
Businca, when swollen in time of flood by the overflow
of the Danube, covered some spaces of the castle,
because the latter stood on the plain. Moreover the
inhabitants of this place had built outside the walls a
wooden church which overhung the water, and was
supported by posts driven into the riverbed and by
forked props. In place of a flooring it had a slippery
platform of boards, which were covered by the over-
flowing water whenever it rose above the banks.

1 In the N alitia Dignitatum Quintanis appears as a garrison town,
commanded by the praefectus alae primae Flavii Raetorum. It is now
represented by Osterhofen.

² Eugippius, whose earlier years were spent in the Danubian lands,
tells of conditions there as he remembers them many years before the
close of the fifth century. Raetia Secunda then included, nominally
at least, the plain country between the Alps, the Inn, and the Dan-
ube; Raetia Prima, the whole central Alpine region. It seems clear
that at the time of his writing (511) Raetia Secunda lay entirely in
the Alps, and comprised the eastern part of the old Raetia Prima;
while from the level country to the north, subJ‘ect though it might be
to the more or less shadowy overlordship of Theodoric the Ostrogoth
as successor os Old Rome, all vestiges of the provincial name and
administration had vanished. E. A. Quitzmann, Die alteste Geschichte
der Baiern (Brunswick, 1873), p. 123.
