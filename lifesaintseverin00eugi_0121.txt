LETTER TO EUGIPPIUS 113

wide the worship and altars of demons‚¹ and decorated
with perennial garlands they provided a civic crown for
their glorious country.

For this reason also I rejoice that through a bro-
ther's service something is provided for the ornaments
of the bride of Christ;2 not that at any time, as I
believe, have there been lacking illustrious examples of
the elders‚ but because it is fitting that the palace os
the Great King should have the standards of many
victories. For true virtue is not obscured by the
multitude of virtues, but yearns for their increase, and
is enlarged thereby.³

¹ I Maccabees, iii, 83 ν, 44, 68; x, 83 f.

² Revelation, xxi, 2, 9.

³ “ As one lamp lights another nor grows less,
So nobleness enkindles nobleness.”
