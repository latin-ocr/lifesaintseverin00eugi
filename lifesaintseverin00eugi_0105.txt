THE LIFE OF SEVERINUS 97

On the day of Epiphany, when Saint Lucillus the
priest had announced in agitation that on the mor-
row he was to perform the annual rites of commemora-
tion for the burial day of his abbot, Saint Valentine,l
formerly bishop of the Raetias, the servant of God
replied, “If Saint Valentine hath committed these
rites to thee to be performed, Ι too, being about to
depart from the body, bequeath to thee the care of
my funeral festival, which shall be observed upon the
same day.'' Lucillus, an old and broken man, was
greatly shaken at this saying, and rather commended
himself earnestly to the protection of Severinus, on
the ground that he was likely to pass away first. But
Severinus answered, ‘¹ Holy priest, this thing which
thou hast heard shall come to pass, nor shall the
Lord’s ordinance be brought to naught by the will of
man.''

¹ There is a life of Valentine in Matthaeus Rader's Bavaria Sancta
(Monaci, 1615—27)‚ i, ff. 24b, 25, 26a, with a fine engraving represent-
ing the saint in his arboreal retreat.

“ Rura Valentinum tutantur, et oppida pellunt.
Fas regnat ruri, regnat in urbe nefas.''

V alentine is also mentioned by Venantius Fortunatus (Vita Sancti
Martini, iv, 644-648):
“ Si vacat ire viam neque te Bajovarius obstat,
Qua vicina sedent Breonum loca, perge per Alpem,
Ingrediens rapido qua gurgite volvitur Aenus.
Inde Valentini benedicti templa require,
Norica rura petens, ubi Byrrus vertitur undis.''
