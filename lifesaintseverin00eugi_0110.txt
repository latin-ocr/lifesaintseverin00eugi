102 EUGIPPIUS

him be the glory for ever and ever.''

After this edifying address, he bade all in succession
approach for his kiss. He received the sacrament of
the communion; and altogether forbade that they
should weep for him. Having stretched out his hand,
and made the sign of the cross over his whole body,
he commanded that they should sing a psahn. When
the grief that overspread them kept them silent, he
himself started the psahn‚ “ Praise ye the Lord in his
sanctuary; let everything that hath breath praise the
Lord.'' 2 And so, on the eighth of January, repeating
this verse, while we could hardly make the responses‚
he fell asleep in the Lord.

When he was buried, our elders, implicitly believing
that, like his many other prophecies‚ what he had fore-
told in regard to our removal could not fail to come to
pass, prepared a wooden casket;³ that When the pre-
djcted migration of the people should take place, the
commands of the prophet might be sulfilled.

⁸ Locellum: in the next chapter, loculum. Andre Baudrillart‚ in
his biography, Saint Se'verin‚ Apbtre du N orique (Paris, 1908), p. 192,
speaks of this coffin as ‘¹ une sorte de chapelle portative ou d'oratoire,'’
and represents the monks, throughout the removal to Italy, as ‘ pray-
ing and singing in it day and night.' This monstrous misconception
may serve as a sufficient sample of the insouciance with which M.
Baudrillart has performed his task.
