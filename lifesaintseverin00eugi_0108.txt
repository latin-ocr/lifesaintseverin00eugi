100 EUGIPPIUS

I will say. I will refer you to the examples of the
elders, whose saith follow, considering the end of their
conversation.¹ For Abraham, when called of the
Lord, obeyed in saith. He went forth into a place
which he was to receive into his possession; and he
went forth not knowing whither he was to go. There-
fore imitate the saith of this blessed patriarch, copy
after his holiness, despise the things of earth, seek ever
the heavenly home. Moreover I trust in the Lord,
that eternal gain shall come to me from you. For I
perceive that ye have enlarged my joy by the fervor
of your spirit, that ye love justice, that ye cherish the
bonds of brotherly love, that ye neglect not chasffity,
that ye guard the rule of humility. These things, so
far as the eye of man hath power to see, I confidently
praise and approve. But pray that those things which
to human view are worthy, may be confirmed by the
test of the eternal judgment3 for God seeth not as
man seeth. Indeed, as the divine word declareth‚ he
searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imag-
inations of the thoughts.2 Therefore constantly hope
and pray for this, that God may enlighten the eyes of
your understandjng‚³ and open them, as blessed Elisha
prayed‚ that ye may see ⁴¹ what hosts of saints sur-
round and support you, what mighty aids are prepared
for the faithful. For our God draws nigh to them
that are without guile. Let the soldiers of God fail
