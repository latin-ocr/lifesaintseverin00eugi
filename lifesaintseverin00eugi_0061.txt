THE LIFE OF SEVERINUS 53

in inviting his company and protection3 believing that
no missortune would happen to them in his presence.
This came to pass not without the aid of divine grace,
that all might stand in awe of his commands‚ as of
heavenly oracles, and be armed for good works through
his example.

Moreover the holy man, summoned by the prayers
of the vicinage, came to a castle named Cucullis,l
and there a mighty miracle was wrought‚ which I
cannot pass by in silence. We heard the amazing
story from Marcianus, a citizen of the same town,
later our priest. A part oi the populace of Cucullis
continued to practise abominable sacrifices at a cer-
tain spot.2 When he learned of this sacrilege, the

say ‘ fort’ in the frontier sense of a fortified settlement. See Du
Gange, Glossarium Mediae et I nfimae Latinitatis, s. v.,· and compare
Salvian, De Gubernatione Dei, v, 44.

1 Now Kuchel.

² Amedee Thierry interprets these as “ sacrifices humains‚ pour
apaiser la destinee.'' Recits de t’Hz'stoire Romaine au V⁶ Siecle (Paris,
1860), p. 148. It is doubtful if we are justified in pushing specification
so far. Any heathen rites would have appeared ‘ abominable ¹ both
to Severinus and to Eugippius. A Christian writer who wishes to
accuse pagans of human sacrifices is likely to make the charge in so
many words. Ennodius does so (De Vita Beati Antoni, 13) in speak-
ing οἱ the heathen barbarian tribes — Franks, Heruli, Saxons — who
were ravaging the Pannonias at this time or a little later.

Mention was made above (Chapter V, note) of this passage in the
Life of Antonius. Though Ennodius speaks of ‘ the Pannonias,' the
connection makes it clear that his account is intended to apply also
to Noricum, particularly the territory about Lauriacum. Antonius
was nephew os Constantius, bishop of Lauriacum, who is named below
(Chapter XXX), and after the death of Severinus remained at Lau-
riacum under the protection of his uncle until the latter’s decease.
