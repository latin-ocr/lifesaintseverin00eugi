PREFACE

ΙΤ has been said of the French, and might with equal
truth be said of the Germans, that they make all excel-
lent pieces of antiquity their own. That we are yet
far from being in a position to make the same boast
in behalf of our noble English tongue; that our defi-
ciency is particularly great as respects the last cen-
turies of ancient civilization, which have so immediate
a relation to the mediaeval and modern worlds3 and
that in those centuries it would be difficult to find a
writing more worthy of introduction to English read-
ers than the work which Teuffel terms “ the incom-
parable biography of Saint Severinus ”z these facts,
Ι trust, may be considered in some measure to justify
the present publication.

This translation of the Life of Severinus, the first,
so far as appears, in our language,l is from the recen-
sion of the text by Theodor Mommsen, published at
Berlin, in 1898, in the series of Scriptores Rerum Ger-

1 Professor Carlton H. Hayes translates Chapters I, II, VII, XX,
and XL, and parts of V, VIII, and XI, in An Introduction to the S ources
relating to the Germanic Invasions (N ew York, 1909), pp. 1 28-1 3 3. His
translation seems to be made, not from the Latin text, but from the
German version of Rodenberg.
