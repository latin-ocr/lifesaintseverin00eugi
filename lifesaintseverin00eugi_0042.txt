bank of the Danube a vast number of boats from the
Raetias, laden with great quantities of merchandise,
which had been hindered for many days by the thick
ice of the river Aenus.2 When at last God's command
had loosed the ice, they brought down an abundance

bestower of unhoped relies 3 for they had expected to
perish, wasted by the long famine, and they acknowl-
edged that manifestly the boats had come out of due
season‚ loosed from the ice and frost by the prayers of
the servant of God.³
