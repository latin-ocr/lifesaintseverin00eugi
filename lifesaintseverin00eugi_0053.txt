THE LIFE OF SEVERINUS 45

Now from that time when health was restored to
the man who had been thought incurable‚ the whole
nation of the Rugii resorted to the servant of God, and
began to render grateful obedience, and to ask help

the wars which the devil wages against them. They are not afraid,
when the shrill battle-trumpet announces Satan's onset, and urges to
the fight. Daily combat ever makes soldiers skined and bmve, while
a long peace relaxes them.'’
