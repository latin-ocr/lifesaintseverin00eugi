108 EUGIPPIUS

At this solemnity many affiicted by divers diseases,
whom it would be tedious to enumerate, were instantly
healed. Arnong them was a venerable handmaid of

from another manuscript, under the title of Translatio SanctiSeverini or
Historia T ranslationis, in Acta Sanctorum, January, i (1643), pp. 1100—
1 103, and reprinted thence in M onumenta Germaniae H istorica: Scrip-
tores Rerum Langobardicarmn et Italicarum Saec. VI—IX (Hannoverae,
1878), pp. 45 2—459. —— It should be noted, however, that Luigi Para-
scandolo, in his M emorie Storiche-Critiche-Diplomatiche della C hiesa di
Napoli (Naples, 1847—51)‚ ii, pp. 253 f„ doubts the authenticity of this
narrative, which, he thinks, owes at least its present form to the labor
of some Benedictine monk living in the monastery of Saint Severinus
at the time of the revival of learning.— Descriptions of the monastery,
now for the most part secularized and occupied by the Royal Neapo-
litan State Archives, and of the church of Saints Severinus and Sosius
connected with it, may be found in Napoli e i Luoghi celebri delle
sue Vicinanze (Naples, 1845), i, pp. 23 3—243, and in the current guide-
books.

Here the remains of Severinus reposed for many centuries, not in
the large church, but beneath the great altar of the smaller primitive
church, or chapel, connected with it. The inscription on the great
altar is given in Acta Sanctorum, January, i, p. 499:

“ Hic duo sancta simul divinaque corpora Patres
Sosius unanimes et Severinus habent.’'

According to Sebastian Brunner (Leben des St. Severin, Vienna, 1879,
p. 170), the following inscription was found in the crypt when it was
opened in 1807: “ Divis Severino Noricorum in Oriente Apostolo et
Sosio Levitae B. Januarii Episcopi in Passione socio Templum ubi
eorum SS. Corpora sub Altare maJ'ori requiescunt et Apostolico in·
dultu cum oblatione sacra purgantes animae liberantur.’'

The fourth removal was on May 30, 1807, after the dissolution of
the monastery under the F rench domination, to the town of Fratta
Maggiore, a few miles north of Naples. Stanislao d‘Aloe, in N apoli e
