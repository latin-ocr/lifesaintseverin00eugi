THE LIFE OF SEVERINUS 67

Christ comforted the feeble ones with spiritual words,
saying‚ “ Had ye offered tithes for the poor, not only
would ye enjoy an everlasting reward, but ye would
also be able to abound in present comforts. But
since ye rebuke your sin by your own confession, I

finitimos.’' Annales Ecclesiastici, a. 475, sects. 30-3 5. There seems,
however, no sufficient reason for linking the dearth at Lauriacum with
that in Gaul, in the winter of 474—7 5, of which Sidonius and Gregory
speak. The latter was caused, not by the fault of the season, but by
the depredations of the Visigoths.
