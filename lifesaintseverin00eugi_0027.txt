LETTER TO PASCHASIUS 19

them silent he can more easily avoid vainglory Ρ ¹
For vainglory is like the left hand, without whose
knowledge 2 he desireth through the gift of Christ to
accomplish every good work; that so he may deserve
to be among those on Christ’s right hand,3 and to be
enrolled as a citizen of the celestial country. And if
thou knowest that I, though unworthy, truly desire
that celestial country, what need that thou learn the
earthly country of which thou askest? But know
that the same God who called thee to the priesthood,
commanded me also to minister unto 'these perilled
folk.'' The answer silenced Primenius, nor did any
one before or after presume to question the saint upon
this matter.

Yet his speech revealed a man of purest Latin stock;
and it is understood that he first departed into some
desert place of the East because of his fervid desire
for a more perfect life, and that thence, constrained by
divine revelation, he later came to the towns of River-
side Noricum, near Upper Pannonia, which were
harassed by frequent incursions of the barbarians. So
he himself was wont to hint, in obscure language as if
speaking of another, naming some cities of the East,
and indicating that he had passed by miracle through
the dangers of an immense journey.4
