THE LIFE OF SEVERINUS 35

CHAPTER IV

AT the same time barbarian robbers made an unex-
pected plundering incursion‚ and led away captive all
the men and cattle they found without the walls.
Then many of the citizens flocked weeping to the man
of God, recounted to him the destructive calamity
that had corne upon them, and showed him evidences
of the recent rapine.

But he straitly questioned Mamertinus, then a
tribune, who afterwards was ordained bishop‚ whether
he had with him any armed men with whom to
institute an energetic pursuit of the robbers. Mamer-
tinus replied, “I have soldiers, a very few. But I
dare not contend with such a host of enemies. How-
ever, if thou commandest it, venerable father, though
we lack the aid of weapons yet we believe that through
thy prayers we shall be victorious.'' And the servant
of God said, “ Even if thy soldiers are unarmed, they
shall now be armed from the enemy. For neither
numbers nor fleshly courage is required, when every-
thing proves that God is our champion. Only in the
name of the Lord advance swiftly‚ advance confi-
dently. For when God in his compassion goes
before, the weakest shall seem the bravest. The
Lord shall fight for you,l and ye shall be silent.
Then make haste3 and this one thing observe above
everything‚ to conduct unharmed into my presence
those of the barbarians whom thou shalt take.''
