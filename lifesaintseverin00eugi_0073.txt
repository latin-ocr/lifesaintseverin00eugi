THE LIFE OF SEVERINUS 65

grateful devotion, as though they were hearing it
given by the lips of an angel present among them.
The cold, too, was felt by the man of God only in the
nakedness of the poor. Indeed, he had received from
God the special gift of remaining vigorous and active,
hardened by his wonderful abstinence, in a land of
bitter cold.

We spoke of tithes for the support of the poor. He
was wont to send letters, urging the communities of
Noricum ¹ also to give them. This became their
custom, and once, when they had sent to him a
quantity of clothing to be distributed, he asked the
attendants whether the town of Tiburnia2 was send-
ing a like contribution. They answered that men
from that place also would soon arrive. But the man
of God signified that they should not come, and fore-
told that the offering which they had delayed must be
made to the barbarians. Accordingly, not long after
the citizens of Tiburnia were beleaguered by the Goths‚
and fought them with varying fortune; and under the*

other hand, follows Saint Augustine. ‘¹ Probably,’' says M. V iard,
‘⁶ he did not speak of the tithe in the exact sense of the word; he
wished merely to call forth the charitable gifts of the communities
that he evangelized. It is very probable that the saint thought, in
doing this, to revive the ancient tithe, modifying it, however, accord-
ing to the needs of the moment and his personal disinterestedness.
The biographer has exaggerated this thought of his hero in order to
make it appear an actuality.''

¹ Here, as elsewhere when he uses the word without a modifier,
Eugippius means Noricum Mediterraneum, the interior or southern
province, of which Tiburnia was the chief town.
