1 04 EUGIPPI US

Ferderuchus, unmindful of the adjuration and pro-
phecy of the holy man, seized all the possessions of the
monastery, and left only the walls, which he could not
carry across the Danube. But presently the threat-
ened vengeance came upon him. For within the space
of a month he was slain by Fredericus, his brother's
son, and lost booty and ljfe together.

Therefore King Odoacer waged war upon the Rugii.
They were defeated, Fredericus was compelled to flee.
His father Feva was taken prisoner, and removed to
Italy with his wicked wife.1

Later, Odoacer heard that Fredericus had returned
to his home. At once he dispatched a great army,
under his brother Onoiilfus; before whom Fredericus

at Novae,2 a city of the province of Moesia.

Onoiilfus, however, at his brother⁷s command or-

¹ A long and entertaining account of a triumph celebrated by
Odoacer at Rome after his victory, given by A. Thierry in his Recits
de Z’Hiseoire Romaine au V⁰ Siecle, iii (Paris, 1860), pp. 352 ff., is
purely a product of Thierry’s luxuriant imagination. His invention
is, however, unsuspectingly accepted as historical fact by Leopold von
Ranke (Weltgeschichte, iv, 1, Leipsic, 1883, p. 377) and J. B. Bury
(The Later Roman Empire from Arcadius to Irene, London‚ 1889, i,
p- 289)-

Paulus Diaconus (De Gestis Langobardorum, i, 19) says that
Odoacer put Feletheus to death. As to Giso's fate we know nothing
beyond what is declared by Eugippius. Thierry’s statement (Recits,
p. 353), followed by Bury (Later Roman Empire, i, p. 289), that she
was “ thrown into a dungeon,’' rests on no authority.

² Perhaps now Sistova, in Bulgaria.
