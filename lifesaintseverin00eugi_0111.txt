THE LIFE OF SEVERINUS 103

CHAPTER XLIV

FERDERUCHUS was poor and ungodly, a greedy bar-
barian, and more greedy than the barbarians. When
he learned of the death of Saint Severinus, he deter-
mined to carry off the clothing allotted to the poor,
and some other things. Joining sacrilege to this crime,
he ordered that the silver goblet and the rest of the
altar service be carried off. Since the service was on
the holy altars, the bailiff who was sent dared not
stretch out his hands to such a villainy, but compelled
a certain soldier, Avitianus by name, to commit the
robbery. Although Avitianus executed the order un-
willingly, he was from that moment plagued by an
incessant trembling in all his limbs, and furthermore
was possessed by a devil. Therefore he quickly set
right his sins by adopting a better purpose. For he
assumed the vow of the sacred profession, exchanged
the weapons of earth for those of heaven, and with-
drew to a lonely isle.l

¹ Islands play an exceedingly large part in the history of monasti-
cism in the Occident. The islands of the Mediterranean, the isles of
Dalmatia and of the Tyrrhenian Sea, swarmed with monks: not to
mention other well-known examples. Lucas Holstenius, Codex Regu-
larum M onasticarum (Augustae Vindelicorum, 1759), i, p. ix; Sulpi-
cius Severus, De Beati Martini Vita, vi, 53 Rutilius Namatianus‚ De
Reditu suo, i, 439—452 (Caprariaz “ Squalet lucifugis insula plena
viris ’'); Hilarius Arelatensis, De Vita Sancti Honorati, iii, 16, 17, in
Migne's Patrologia Latina, vol. l, coll. 1257 f. (Lerina).

The encircling watery barrier answered a threefold purpose. It
served as protection alike against the enticements of the world, the
sword of the barbarian, and (according to the popular belief) the as-
saults of demons.
