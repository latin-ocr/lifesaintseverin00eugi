diseases, and some who were oppressed by unclean
spirits, experienced the instant healing of divine grace.
A certain dumb man also was brought to this castle
through the compassion of his kinsmen. He eagerly
entered the oratory, where the body of the holy man
still lay upon the wagon, and when he offered suppli-
cation behind the closed door of his mouth, in the
chamber of his heart, immediately his tongue was
loosed in prayer, and he spoke praise unto the Most
High. And when he returned to the inn where he was
wont to lodge, and was questioned as usual by nod and
sign, he answered in a clear voice, that he had prayed
and had offered praise to God. When he spoke‚ they
who knew him were terrified and ran shouting to the
oratory and told Saint Lucillus the priest, and us, who
were with him and knew nothing of the event. Then
we all rejoiced exceedingly, and returned thanks to
the divine mercy.
