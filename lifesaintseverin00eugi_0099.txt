THE LIFE OF SEVERINUS 91

CHAPTER XXXVII

MARCIANUS the monk‚ who was afterward priest, and
who preceded me in the headship of the monastery,
was sent by Severinus to Noricum in company with
Brother Renatus. As the third day was passing, the
saint said to the brethren‚ “ Pray, dearly beloved, for
at this hour grievous tribulation is upon Marcianus
and Renatus, from which nevertheless they shall be
freed by Christ's aid.'' Then the monks straightway
wrote down what he had said; and when many months
later Marcianus and Renatus returned, and made
known the day and hour of their peril, at which they
had escaped the barbariam, these were found to be
just as had been written down.

of which the three monks were guilty was some form of insubordina—
tion. The relation between humility and obedience in the monk is
discussed by H. Β. Workman in his essay, T he Evolution of the M 0-
nastic Ideal (London‚ 1913), pp. 68-74. ‘⁴ The third fundamental idea
of Monasticism,” he says, “first specifically introduced by Pacho-
mius, was the renunciation of the will. This is sometimes called
obedience, sometimes humility; in reality, from the Monastic stand-
point the two tend to become one. The two are related as cause and
effect; they are different aspects of that complete sels-renunciation
which is higher than any mere outer surrender. The man who has
nailed his inner self to the cross cannot be otherwise than humble;
while the humble man will show his humility by a perfect obedience.”
