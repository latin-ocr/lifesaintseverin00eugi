THE LIFE OF SEVERINUS 39

grace of God had elevated by such virtues was wont
to make acknowledgment with utmost humility, and
to say, “ Thjnk not that what ye see is of my merit.
It is rather an example for your salvation. Let the
foolhardiness of man cease. Let the pride oi exalta-
tion be restrained. That we can do anything good,
we are chosen; as the apostle ¹ saith, ‘ He hath chosen
us before the foundation of the world, that we should
be holy and without blame before him.' 2 Pray rather
in my behalf that the gifts of the Saviour to me may
serve not for greater condemnation, but for increase of

so hard that it will support like a solid rock an army of infantry, and
carts and sleds, or whatsoever vehicles there may be.''

It is probable that modern regulation of the current os the Danube
by engineering works has had a tendency to prevent the formation of
extensive ice fields. Yet even now the stream is frozen annually in
Lower Hungary throughout several long stretches, which at the height
of the frost can occasionally be crossed with carts or sleds. In Ba-
varia, Austria, and Rumania, field ice does not form every winter.
Yet it sometimes happens even at Vienna — most recently in Janu-
ary, 1901 ——that the ice is strong enough to allow foot travellers
a safe passage across the river.

1 It may be noted that in Eugippius the expression ‘ the apostle ’
always refers to Saint Paul. Eugippius never bestows upon Severi-
nus the appellation ⁴ apostle of Noricum ' (apostolus Norici or aposto-
lus Noricorum), later so common.
