THE LIFE OF SEVERINUS 79

CHAPTER XXVIII

AFTER the destruction of the towns on the upper course
of the Danube, all the people who had obeyed the
warnings of Saint Severinus removed into the town of
Lauriacum. He warned them with incessant exhorta-
tions not to put trust in their own strength, but to
apply themselves to prayers and fastings and alms-
givings, and to be defended rather by the weapons of
the spirit.

Moreover one day the man of God appointed that
all the poor be gathered together in one church, that
he might, as custom demanded, dispense oil to them:
a commodity which in those places was brought to
market only after a most difficult transport by traders.
Accordingly a great throng of the needy assembled,
as if for the sake of receiving the benediction. No
doubt the presence of this fluid, a costly food, swelled

join him3 rather, weakening them. So was the strength of the brave
citizens of Passau paralyzed.'’ Die Gesclzichte der Vblkerwanderung,
ii, p. 397. It would not, however, be fair to make this citation from
Pallmann without quoting also the passage (ibid, pp. 400 f.) in which
he sums up his opinion of the saint and his public activities. “ It is
a strange, noble, powerful figure, this monk. . . . A political head
would certainly have acted wholly otherwise than Severinus. We do
not know whether he would have had better success. Yet it was a
piece of good fortune, that in the disastrous time after the death of
Aetius, when on every side the dissolution of the Empire, like the
death‘of a human body, was beginning at the extremities, and the prov-
inces one by one were renouncing their connection with Italy; when
we see Gaul independent under Aegidius, Dalmatia under Marcel-
linus; that in Noricum, if no general arose, yet at least a pure and
lofty spirit sought to do the works of righteousness.'’
