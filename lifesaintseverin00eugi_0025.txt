LETTER TO PASCHASIUS 17

when no master has constructed‚ and no proper
foundation has been· laid? So I, who have with
difficulty prepared and most miserably put together
the precious material for thy genius, ought Ι to be
thought to have composed what Ι desire, when a
liberal education has not fashioned the work, nor
literary training lent it elevation and elegance ? My
work has, indeed, the sure foundation of saith alone ;
that foundation upon which, as thou knowest, rose
the saint's admirable, resplendent virtues ; and now
I commit the materials to the architect, whose hands
shall be thy eloquence; and when the capstone is
placed upon thy work, Ι shall return due thanks to
Christ.

I beg that thou have the goodness to mention also
those miraculous cures, which, either on the journey or
here, were wrought by divine virtue unto the memory
of the blessed father Severinus. Since the trusty
bearet, thy son Deogratias, best knows these, I have
entrusted to him to communicate them to thee by

, word of mouth. And Ι hope that I may speedily be

able yet again to call him bearer on the completion of
thy work, that so this most faithful servant of God,
rich in such great virtues, while he is carried to the
glory of the saints by his merits vouchsafed through
Christ's grace may by thy pen be immortalized to
human memory.

It may perhaps be asked, and with justice, from
what country Severinus sprang3 since with this partic-
ular it is the custom to begin the story of any life. Ι
