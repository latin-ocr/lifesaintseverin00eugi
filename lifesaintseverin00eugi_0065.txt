THE LIFE OF SEVERINUS 57

anxiously to his field, he found it swept perfectly bare
by the baleful work of the locusts, while all the sowings
round about were untouched. Utterly amazed‚ he
returned with doleful outcries to the castle. When he
had published what had happened, all went out to see
the miracle3 where the ravages of the locusts had
marked out as if by a ruled line the corn plot of this
contumacious fellow. Then he cast himself at their
feet and with lamentations begged for the pardon of his
sin by the aid of their intercession. Wherefore the
man of God took occasion to give a warning, and
taught all that they should learn to obey the Lord
omnipotent‚ whose commands even the locusts
observe.

But the poor man, weeping‚ declared that, for the
rest, he could obey the commands‚ if but a hope of
wherewithal he might live had been left him. Then
the man of God addressed the others. “It is just‚''
he said, “ that he who through his own punishment
hath given you an example of humility and obedience
should of your liberality receive sustenance for the
present year.'' So the poor man, both rebuked and
enriched by a collection from the faithful, learned
what loss unbeh'ef infficts, and what benefit God's
bounty bestows upon his worshippers.
