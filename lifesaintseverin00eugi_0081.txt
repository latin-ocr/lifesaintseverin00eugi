THE LIFE OF SEVERINUS 73

few barbarians, attacked the town of Batavis, as the
saint had foretold‚ and, while almost all the inhabi-
tants were occupied in the harvest, put to death forty
men of the town who had remained for a guard. The
priest who had spoken sacrilegious words in the
baptistery against the servant of Christ fled for refuge
to the same place, and was slain by the pursuing bar-
barians. For in vain did the offender against God
and enemy of truth seek protection in the place where
he had so impudently transgressed.

CHAPTER XXIII

ONCE while Saint Severinus was reading the Gospel in
the monastery at Favianis, after offering prayer he
arose, ordered a skiff to be instantly prepared for him,
and said to the astonished bystanders‚ “ Blessed be
the name of the Lord3 we must go to meet the relies
of the sainted martyrs.'' They crossed the Danube
without delay, and found a man sitting on the farther
bank of the river, who besought them with many
prayers to conduct him to the servant of God, whose
fame was widespread, and to whom he had long wished
to come. The servant of Christ was pointed out to

king of the Suevi‚ a principal leader in a war, not yet remote in time,
that had devastated Central Europe for years.

We may infer from the smallness of the force under the command os
Hunimund that the attack on Bojotro was made after the destructive
overthrows of the Suevi by the Ostrogoths3 perhaps in 474 or 475.
The sequence of Eugippius's narrative points to the same date.
