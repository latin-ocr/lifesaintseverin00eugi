were fed by his activity. To these he ministered with
such cheerful concern, that he believed himself to be
filled or to abound in all good things only when he
saw that the needy had their bodily wants supplied.
Though he himself was not in the least enfeebled by
repeated week-long fasts, yet he felt himself afflicted
by the hunger of the unfortunate. When they saw
his pious largess to the poor, great numbers, although
they were straitened with hunger under the harsh
sway of the barbarians, faithfully gave the poor the
tithes of their crops. T hough this commandment is
familiar to all from the law,1 yet these observed it with

¹ Paul Viard, Histoire de la Dime Ecclesiaslique (Dijon, 1909), gives
an excellent account of the origin of tithing in the early church, and
also (pp. 44 f., 49) discusses this passage at length. Some of his con-
clusions may be briefly stated as follows. The only references to
tithes in the Gospels (MattheW, xxiii, 233 Luke, xi, 42; xviii, 12) are
in rebuke of the hypocrisy of the Pharisees. The Christians of the
first four centuries did not recognize the Jewish tithe. They did in
some instances acknowledge the tax of the first fruits. Insistence
upon the tithe begins to appear about the end of the fourth century.
In the East, its champion was Saint John Chrysostom (I n M althaeum
Homilia lxiv (lxv), in Migne's Patrologia Graeca, lviii, col. 615). In
the West, it was advocated in two forms. Jerome (Explanatio in
Malachiam, iii, 7, in Migne's Patrologia Latina, XXV, coll. 1568—1571;
and Epistola ad Nepotianum de Vita Clericorum et Sacerdotum, in
Migne, xxii, col. 5 31) considers that the ancient law is still in force, and
that the proceeds of the tithe should be for the support of the clergy.
Augustine likewise (Sermones, lxxxv, 4, in Migne, xxxviii, col. 522)
holds to the obligation of the tithe, at least upon the conscience, using
the text MattheW, v, 20, “ except your righteousness shall exceed the
righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees ''; but he directs it to the
support of the poor. The later development of church polity, finally
crystallized into definite enactments at the second council of MAcon
in 585, was a compromise between these two views. Severinus, on the
