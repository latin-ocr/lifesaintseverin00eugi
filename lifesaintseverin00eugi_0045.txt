THE LIFE OF SEVERINUS 37

quiet of his cell was dear to him, he yet obeyed the
commands of God and built a monastery not far from
the city.1 There he began to instruct great numbers
in the sacred way of life, training the souls of his
hearers rather by deeds than by words.³ He often

“ Villam enim S. Severini, ubi cellam habuit pius pater S. Severinus,
jam ego possideo, ubi nobilissima crescunt vineta, arboribus illic
desectis ac purgatis. . . . a sancto Severino patria lingua Severin
appellatur.''

Cuspinianus calls Severinus “ second apostle of Austria '’ (secun-
darius Austriae apostolus, alter Austranum apostolus), the first being
Quirinus, and reckons him among the six patron saints of that coun-
try: the martyrs Quirinus, Maximilian, Florian; Severinus; Colman
the Irish pilgrim3 Margrave Leopold III the Pious. On p. 70 of his
Austria is printed a poem by Joannes Stabius, “ In Sanctos Austriae
Patronos Precatio,’' in forty-six hexameter verses. The poem con-
tains, however, nothing which seems to have individual reference to
Severinus, unless it be in vv. 32—38:

“ Praesidio semper secura sit Austria vestro.
Morborum omne genus, quae corpora nostra fatigant,
Infandumque malum, crudelem avertite pestem.

Sit flavae Cereris, laeti sit copia Bacchi:

Tartareo sonitu reboent nec classica Martem,

Sed Pax alma ferens ramum felicis olivae

Illustret terras, soror et Concordia mitis.”

1 It will be noted that the monasteries founded by Saint Severinus
were in the immediate neighborhood of cities. F. W. Rettberg calls
attention to this fact, and to its accordance with the monastic rule of
Saint Basil the Great: with which, he suggests, Severinus may have
become familiar during his wanderings in the Orient. Kirchenge-
schichte Deutschlands (Gottingem 1846—48), i, p. 231. Compare E. C.
Butler’s article ‘¹ Basilian Monks,’' in the Encyclopaedia Britannica
(11th ed.).

³ Wolfgang Lazius, using a singular figure, says that “from this
monastery, as if from the Trojan horse, went forth ahnost all the
bishops of N oricum.” Vienna Austriae (Basileae, 1546), p. 54. Lazius
