LETTER OF PASCHASIUS TO
EUGIPPIUS

PASCHASIUS the deacon to the holy and ever most
beloved priest Eugippius.

Dearest brother in Christ, thou measurest me by the
measure of thy skill, eloquence, and happy leisure, and
disdainest to consider my vexatious employments and
manifold imperfections. Yet through the contem-
plation of thy love I sustain the injury to my mod-
esty.l

Thou hast sent me a memoir to which the eloquence
of the trained writer can add nothing, and in a short
compendium hast produced a work which the whole
church can read. The life and character of Saint
Severinus, who dwelt in the provinces bordering on the
Pannonias, thou hast portrayed with much faithful-
ness; and thou hast handed down to the memory of
future generations, to remain through long ageS‚ the
miracles which divine virtue hath wrought through
him. The deeds of the good cannot perish with time.
All persons to whom thy narrative shall bring Saint
Severinus shall have him before them, and shall per-
ceive that in a certain sense he dwells with them. And

² Paschasius here imitates Sulpicius Severus, De Beati Martini
Vita, Praei„ 1: “ Quid enim esset, quod non amori tuo vel cum det-
rimento mei pudoris inpenderem ? ”
