APPENDIX 125

Coming to his sacred burial‚ the dumb received speech,
the blind exulteth to recognize those that walk afar.

Naples‚ rejoice in thy festal crown! Clap thy hands,
keeping the heavenly patron whom the sovereign Author
hath bestowed upon thee as thy honor and help.

For his merits‚ O mercisul Creator, grant us glory and
pardon‚ that above the stars we may ever enjoy the light
of thy worship.

Let us all resound glory to the Father‚ let us in suppli-
ance sing glory unto Christ3 with whom reigneth the Holy
Spirit and Creator.
