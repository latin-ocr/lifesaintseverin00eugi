THE LIFE OF SEVERINUS 41

that, as they had denied this request, he did not doubt
that they would put him to death. Then Flaccitheus
received this reply from the man of God: “ If the one
Catholic saith united us, thou oughtest rather to con-
sult me concerning eternal life; 1 but since thou art

1 A comparison of this passage with the reference, in Chapter VIII,
to Queen Giso's attempt “ to rebaptize certain Catholics,'' makes it
evident that the Rugii, or at least their sovereigns, were, like most of
the converted Germans of the fifth century and even later, Christians
of the Arian sect. The fact that the Rugii were Arians while the pro—
vincials were Catholics cooperated with the difference of race to pro-
duce a lack of complete sympathy and understanding between them.
On the other hand, it was entirely natural that the Rugii, as Chris-
tians, should assume the position towards the provincials that we find
them occupying more and more, of protectors against the depredations
of the German tribes that remained heathen: Alamanni and Thuringi
(Chapter XXXI, below, etc.); Heruli (Chapter XXIV); no doubt
also the Franks and Saxons, whom Ennodius (De Vita Beati Antoni,
12—14) names in connection with the Heruli as devastators of the
Pannonias during the ninth decade of the fifth century— cruel as
wild beasts; turning a populous land into a desert; worshipping gods
who, they believed, could be propitiated only by human victims;
slaughtering clerics by preference, as the sacrifices most acceptable to
their divinities.

Dr. Julius von Pflugk-Harttung's vividly worded description of life
in Noricum in the time of Severinus (Allgemeine Weltgeschichte, iv,
p. 231) is somewhat confusing, because of his failure to point out
clearly this distinctive position of the Rugii. He says, “ They and
their neighbor-tribes, Thuringi, Heruli, Alamanni, and Goths, came
from beyond the Danube in uninterrupted forays.'' There is no men-
tion in the Life of ‘ forays ’ on the part of the Rugii, except in the
strictly technical sectarian sense of the confiscation of the monastery
plate and furniture (Chapter XLIV) ;on the contrary, they them-
selves suffered from plundering raids, as the next paragraph shows.
Dr. Pflugk-Harttung’s reference to the Goths (Ostrogoths) is also not
to the point. They lived, not beyond the Danube but in Pannonia,
on the Roman side of the river (Jordanes‚ De Rebus Geticis, 50). Fur-
