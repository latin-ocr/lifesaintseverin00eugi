Ι 2 2 APPENDIX

Inclitus vates nimiumque felix,

Saepius cui deus intimabat (11, 39,

Tunc ad oppressi populi salutem 40)
Multa futura,

Voce praesaga laqueos latronum (10)

Atque praedonum machinas retexens (4, 5)

Valde tutabat monitis supernis (11, 2 5, 30)

Oppida fessa.
Dulce solamen miseris ministrans
Horridam pestem famis amputavit, (3, 18)

Barbara plures feritate victos (8, 9, 10, 19)
Solvit ab hoste.

Magne confessor, humilis magister, (36)

Tu quidem normam monachis dedisti, (4, 9, 39)

Calle demonstrans sobrio sequaces
Scandere celum.

Vatican manuscript. It is Ozanam’s opinion that it was composed
shortly after the preparation of the Life. The classical purity of form
and the unblurred outline of the story strongly support this view.
After Ozanam, Migne, Sauppe, Knoell, and Mommsen, in their edi-
tions of the Life, and Dreves (as above) have printed the hymn.
Dreves alone has used the Paris manuscript. He has also supplied,
from another hymn with a similar ending, the last three lines of the
final stanza, the Doxology, which is incomplete in the manuscripts.
His text is, however, carelessly printed. Andre Baudrillart gives a
F rench translation as an appendix to his Saint Severin (1908). Sebas-
tian Brunner in his translation of the Life (1879), pp. 181 f., gives in
German a very free metrical paraphrase, “so arranged,” he says,
“ that it might be sung as a church hymn on the festival of the saint.‘’
Its suitability for this purpose is lessened by the fact that Brunner has
inadvertently substituted ‘ Silenus ' for ‘ Silvinus ’ in his rendering of
the ninth stanza.

The text which is here presented follows that of Mommsen, with
some correction of punctuation, and with the completing verses of the
Doxology from Dreves. The marginal numerals in parentheses refer
to chapters of the Life.
