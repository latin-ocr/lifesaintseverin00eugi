7 2 EUGIPPIUS

mock them, but to aid them with his wonted direction.
A certain priest, filled with the spirit of Satan, added,
“ Go, saint, Ι beg, go quickly, that ior a little space thy
departure may give us rest from fastings and vigils.''
At this saying the man of God was oppressed with
great weeping, because a priest‚ in public, had burst
forth in ridiculous gabbling. For open scurrility
is a witness of hidden sins. When the saint was
asked by the brethren why he was weeping thus, “ I
see,'' he said, “a heavy blow that in my absence

expresses the belief that the coincidence in name is purely accidental.
But if the Hunimund of Eugippius was not Hunimund the Suevian
king, who was he? Eugippius through his whole work is perfectly
definite in his identification of persons. He names in all some fifty
characters, aside from those mentioned in the Bible or in the church
fathers. Each is carefully labelled with the appropriate word or
phrase, except tWO, Stilicho (Chapter XXXVI) and Hunimund. It
is a fair inference that Eugippius left these names unqualified—
just as, for example, one would now in similar references that oi

Napoleon or oi Blficher — because no label seemed needed, either for
Stilicho, the great general οἱ the Western Empire, or ior Hunimund,
