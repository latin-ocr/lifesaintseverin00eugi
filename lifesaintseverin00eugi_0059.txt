THE LIFE OF SEVERINUS 51

terrible example of Lot's wife.1 He admonished like-
wise that the incentives to lusts must be mortified in
the sear of the Lord3 and declared that the fires of
sensual delights cannot be conquered, except through
the grace of God they be quenched in the fountain of
tears.

CHAPTER X

THERE was a janitor 2 at the monastery church‚ Mau-
rus by name, whom Saint Severinus had redeemed
from the hands of the barbarians. One day the man
of God warned him, saying‚ “ Τ ake heed to—day not
to go away anywhere: otherwise thou shalt be in
imminent peril.'’ But the janitor, contrary to the
warning of the great father, and persuaded by a lay-

² That this is here the meaning of aedituus is shown by the Table
of Chapters, where it is represented by ostiarius. The office of aedi-
tuus in the pagan temple, however, corresponds rather to that of
custos in the Christian church (see Chapter I, above), being a position
of some dignity. Ausonius, Commemorat-io Professorum Burdigalen-
sium, x, 22—30‚ speaks of Phoebicius, a professor who had been Beleni
aedituus. DuCange gives the definition “ AEDITUUS, Ostiarius‚
gradus ecclesiasticus; cui aedis sacrae custodia incumbit, custos '':
an impossible one, since ostiarius and custos are quite different officials.
The word never really became naturalized in Christian literature.
Paulinus of Nola uses it, it is true (Epistolae, i, 10; in Migne's Patro-
logia Latina, vol. lxi, col. 158); but he was a friend and correspondent
of Ausonius.

Theo Sommerlad, Die Lebensbeschreibung Severius als kulturge-
schichtliche Quelle (Leipsic‚ 1903), p. 33, faiis to notice that Eugippius
uses aedituus and ostiarius interchangeably both at this place and
in Chapter XVI, below, and accordingly wrongly considers aedituus
equivalent to the ecclesiae custos of Chapter Ι.
