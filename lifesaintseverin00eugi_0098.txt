90 EUGIPPIUS

author of sorged letters, ought to be delivered unto
Satan, that he might not dare to commit such crimes
in the future3 and at the same moment, while the
word was yet in the bishop's mouth, the unclean spirit
seized the slave and began to rend him} Sulpicius
Severus, t00, relates‚2 on the authority of Postumianus,
that a certain man, admirable for his great virtues and
miracles, aiming to drive out from his heart the vanity
of ostentation into which he had fallen, procured by
entreaty “ that power over him might be given the
devil for five months, and he be made like those whom
he himself had healed.'' And Sulpicius says, a little
further on, that accordingly “ he was seized by the
devil, held in chains, and endured everything which
those possessed by devils are wont to suffer; until,
finally, in the fifth month he was cured, not merely
from the devil, but (what he needed and desired more)
from the fault.''

So the man of God turned over the three monks to
the brethren, and subjected them for forty days to the
bitter remedy of fasting. When the days were ful-
filled, he spake a prayer over them, and plucked them
forth from the power of the devil, and bestowed upon
them soundness not only of body but of mind. As a
result of this event, the saint was held in enhanced
awe and terror, and a greater sear of discipline pos-
sessed the rest.³
