But he saith, “ By the Lord I adjure thee, let me not be
held here longer, and cheated of the everlasting rest in

Now this event was so concealed at the earnest
request of Saint Severinus, that no one knew of it

An engraving which represents this scene is mentioned in the Pre-

Memorabilia N ordgaviae Veteris (Schwabach‚ 17 34—43) , i, tab. vii,
opposite p. 202. The latter is of especial interest in that it portrays
the two doorkeepers‚ or janitors‚ in military costume‚ one of them
leaning upon a huge battle-axe.
