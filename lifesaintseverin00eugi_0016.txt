8 PREFACE

manicarum. In an AppendiX, pp. 117-121 below, I
have given a list of editions and translations. Momm-
sen's preface contains an account of the manuscripts
of the Life, of the chronology of the time, so far as it
casts direct light upon the careers of Severinus and
Eugippius, and of the references to Eugippius and
Severinus in later ecclesiastical writers.1 One who
desires a more general view of the period may obtain
it by reading the pertinent Chapters of Hodgkin, Dahn‚
or Gibbon, or Julius von Pflugk-Harttung's The Great
M igrations, which, translated from the Allgemeine
Weltgeschichte, forms the sixth volume in Wright’s
H istory of All N ations. Passages referring specifically
to Severinus may be found in Pflugk-Harttung’s vol-
ume, in the English translation, on pages 2 50 f„ 269,
and 296. Julius Jung, in his Ro‘mer und Romamn in
den Donauliindern (Innsbruck, 1877),2 pages 133-141‚
Iso-156, etc.‚ discusses the Life with particular
reference to the light which it sheds upon the ethnog-
raphy and local history of Noricum and the adjacent
provinces. I will also mention the paragraphs on

¹ Mommsen does not mention the passage in the biography of Wil-
libald, the Saxon pilgrim, who visited Naples in 729. “ Et ibi est
prope castella [sic] ubi requiescit sanctus Severinus.’' Vita Willibaldi,
4, in M onumenla Germaniae Historica, Scriptores, xv, 1 (1887).

² In the second edition (Innsbruck, 1887) much of the material
relative to the Life is omitted.
