THE LIFE OF SEVERINUS 107

CHAPTER XLVI

BARBAR1A‚ a lady of rank‚¹ venerated Saint Severinus
with pious devotion. She and her late husband had
known him well by reputation and through correspond-
ence. When, after the death of the saint, she heard
that his body had with great labor been brought
into Italy, and up to that time had not been com-
mitted to earth, she invited by frequent letters our
venerable priest Marcianus, and also the whole
brotherhood. Then with the authorization of Saint
Gelasius‚ pontiff oi the Roman see, and received by
the people of Naples with reverent obsequies‚ the body
was laid to rest by the hands of Saint Victor the bishop
in the Lucullan castle‚2 in a mausoleum which Bar-

baria had built.3

¹ Thomas Hodgkin (Italy and her Jnvaders, iii, Oxford, 1885, pp.
190 f. ;or 2d ed.‚ 1896, pp. 172 f.) seeks to identify Barbaria with the
widow of Orestes and mother of Romulus Augustulus. On this point
see Jung’s Romer und Romanor irz den Donautcinder, p. 1343 and Max
Bfidinger’s Eugiffius, eine U ntersuchung, in Sitzzmgsbericlzte der kaiser-
lichen Akademie der Wissenschaften (Vienna), philosophisch-historische
Classe, xci, 1 (1878), pp. 802 f.

³ Two more translations still awaited the body. October 14, 903,
the Lucullan castle was abandoned through sear of the marauding
Saracens. The remains of the saint were borne in solemn processioa
to the great Benedictine monastery of Saint Severinus, within the
walls of Naples. Joannes Diaconus Neapolitanus, Martyrium Sancti
