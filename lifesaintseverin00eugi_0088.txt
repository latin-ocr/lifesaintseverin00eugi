Then he began with his own hand to fill the measures
of oil for the attendants who conveyed it, copying as a
faithful servant his Lord, who came not to be minis-
tered unto, but to minister.1 And, following in the
way of the Saviour‚ he rejoiced that the substance was
increased, which he poured out with his right hand,
his left hand knowing not.2 When the oil-vessels os
the poor were filled, the oil in the hands of the attend-
ants was not diminished. Now while the bystanders
silently wondered at so great a blessing of God, one of
them, whose name was Pientissimus, in amazement
and great sear cried out, “ My Lord! This pot of oil
increases, and overflows like a fountain1” So, its
miraculous powers having been betrayed, the welcome
fluid was withdrawn. straightway the servant of
Christ cried out and said, “ Brother, what hast thou
done ? Thou hast hindered the advantage of many:
may the Lord Jesus Christ pardon thee! '' So once
the widow woman burdened with debts was bidden by
Elisha the prophet from the small quantity of oil
which she had to fill vessels not a few. After she had
done this, and asked for yet more vessels from her
sons, when she heard that there was not a vessel more,
straightway the oil stayed.³
