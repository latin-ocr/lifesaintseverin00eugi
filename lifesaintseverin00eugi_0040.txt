3 2 EUGIPPIUS

was a sudden‘earthquake;1 and the barbarians who
dwelt within the city were so terrorsmitten that they
compelled the Romans to open the gates for them in
haste. Then they rushed out tumultuously‚ and
scattered, supposing themselves besieged and sur-
rounded by near foes; and their terror was augmented
by divine influence, so that, in the wanderings and
confusion of the night, they slew one another with the
sword. Thus utter destruction consumed the enemy;
and the people, saved by the divine aid, learned
through the saint to fight with heavenly arms.

¹ I think it probable that this is the earthquake mentioned in
Anonymus Cuspiniani, Chronicon (in Thomas Roncallius, Vetustiora
Chronica, Patavii, 1787, ii, col. 124) under the year 455: “ eversa est
Sabaria a Terraemotu VII. idus septemb. die Veneris ⁷'; and in the
same words, and under the same year, in the Excerptum Sangallense
(in Karl F rick, Chronica Minora, vol. 1, 1892, p. 422). Sabaria was
in Upper Pannonia, about seventy miles southeast of Comagenis in a
straight line, or ninety-two Roman miles by road. Antonini Augusti
Itinerarium, pp. 233 f. Wesseling.

The date of this earthquake as given in the chronicles clearly can-
not be correct. The Friday before the Ides fell, in September 455, on
the 9th, not on the 7th. I suggest accordingly that, following
C. F. Roesler (Chronica Medii Aevi, Tubingae‚ 1798, i, p. 341),
we make the obvious emendation, and read “ V. idus Septembres die
Veneris.” Theodor Mommsen (Chronica Minora, Berlin, 1892-98, i,
p. 304; in M onumenta Germaniae Historica) suggests the reading
‘¹ IV.,’' “ nisi in anno erratum est ''; but he cannot be right. One
might, it is true, reach his result by using inadvertently a table like
that in Sir Harris Nicolas's The Chronology os H istory (Lond0n‚ 1835),
p. 49, which contains the dominical letters for 4000 years after the
Christian era, according to the New Style. The N ew Style, however,
does not apply to the fifth century.
