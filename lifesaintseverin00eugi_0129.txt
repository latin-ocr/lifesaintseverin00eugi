A LAT1N HYMN IN PRAISE OF SAINT SEVERINUS²

Canticum laudis domino canentes

Hunc diem festum celebremus omnes,

Quo Severinus penetravit almus
Celsa polorum.

Quis stilo dives modulansque plectro

Cuncta signorum replicare possit,

Quae potens Christus studiis opimis
Contulit ejus ?

¹ Tillemont, whose accuracy is commonly unimpeachable, says of
the Life (M emoires pour servir a l'Histoz're Ecclesiastique des six Pre-
miers Siecles, Paris, 1 701—1 2, xvi, p. 180) “ Elle est traduite en francois
dans les Saints illustres de Mr. d'Andilli.” A careful search, how-

scripts of about the end of the tenth century, Codex Vaticanus 7172
and MS. 1092 of the Bibliotheque Nationale at Paris. Guido Maria
Dreves has printed it from these, under the title of H ymnarius Severi-
nhmus, as volume xiv a of Analecta H ymnica Medii Aevi (Leipsic,
1893). In it are two hymns (34 and 35, in Dreves’s edition) in praise
of Saint Severinus. The second dates from the tenth century, as is
shown by its reference to the signs and wonders that accompanied the
translation of the relics of the saint from the Lucullan castle to Naples.
It contains nothing of biographical interest. The other was first pub-
lished by Antoine Frederic Ozanam, in his Documents Ine‘dits pour
servir a Z'Histoire Litteraire de l’Italie (Paris, 18 50),pp. ²41 ff, from the
