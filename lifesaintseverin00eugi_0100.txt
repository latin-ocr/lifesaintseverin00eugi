92 EUGIPPIUS

CHAPTER XXXVIII

ALso most blessed Severinus suddenly commanded
one of the brethren, by name Ursus, to meet in ad-
vance a coming calamity by a strict fast of forty days,
with abstinence from food, and lamentations‚ saying,
“ A bodily peril threatens thee, which through God's
protection thou shalt avert by the remedy of a scanty
diet of bread and water.’' So on the fortieth day a
deadly pustule appeared on the arm of the fasting
man, which he immediately showed to Severinus,
approaching him as a suppliant. The holy servant of
God said unto him, “ Do not sear the crisis which was
foretold thee forty days ago ''; and straightway with
his own hand made the sign of the cross over it;
whereupon the fatal pustule vanished, to the amaze-
ment of the bystanders.

Let it suffice to have told of this one of his cures in
his own household, that I may avoid the tediousness of
a lengthy task. For often through the revelation of
Christ he foretold the illnesses of his monks, and
healed them through the same gifts by which he fore-
saw them.

CHAPTER XXXIX

THE spiritual teacher‚ continuing instant in prayer
and tasting, dwelt not far from the cell of his disciples.
With them he regularly completed the morning
pmyers, and the proper psalm—singing in the evening.
