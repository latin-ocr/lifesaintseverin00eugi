in that hour besprinkled with human blood; and

ONE Paulinus, a priest, had come to Saint Severinus,
whose fame was extending.¹ He tarried some days
in the company of the saint. When he wished to
return home, Severinus said to him, “ Hasten, vener-
able priest; for⁷ beloved, the episcopal dignity shall
speedily adorn thee, even if, as we believe, thou op-
posest the desire of the peoples.'’ And presently‚
when he returned to his own country, the word of the
prophet was fulfilled unto him. For the citizens of
Tiburnia, which is the metropolis of Noricum, com-
pelled him to assume the preeminence of the highest
priesthood.

¹ It would indeed be an evidence of an extensive fame, were we able
to accept Mr. Hodgkin's ingenious conjecture as to the source of the
penultimate name of the celebrated philosopher and poet Anicius
Manlius Severinus Boethius, who was born at Rome probably during
the eighth decade of the fifth century. Italy and her Invmiers, iii
(1885), p. 5²3 (or 2d ed., 1896, p. 471): ‘⁴ Severinus was no doubt
given to him in honour of one of the holiest names of the fifth century,
the saintly hermit of Noricum.’'
