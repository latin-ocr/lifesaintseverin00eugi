42 EUGIPPIUS

anxious only over present safety, which is of common
concern to us both, hear my instruction. Be not
troubled by the multitude of the Goths or by their
emnity. They shall soon depart and leave thee
secure, and thou shalt reign in the prosperity which
thou hast desired. Only do not neglect the warn—
ings of my humility. Let it not irk thee to seek
peace even with the least; never lean upon thine own
strength. ‘ Cursed be the man‚' saith the Scripture,
‘ that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and
whose heart departeth from the Lord.' 1 Learn
therefore to beware of snares, not to lay them: and
thou shalt die in thy bed ² with a peaceful end.''

ther, they were Christians‚ partially civilized, and usually in alliance
with the Romans against their barbarian enemies. After the death
of Attila there appears to have been only one period, comprising a few
months of the year 473, in which the Ostrogoths were hostile to the
Western Empire (ibid, 56). It is to that time that we may very rea-
sonably assign their attack upon Tiburnia in Noricum Mediterraneum
(Chapter XVII).

It is regrettable that The Cambridge Medieval History, i (1911)
repeats the false view of the position of the Rugii. Mr. Ernest Bar-
ker, the writer of chapter xiv therein, “Italy and the lVest, 410-476,''
says (p. 420) “ The Rugii . . . appear in the history of the time . . .
as vexing with their inroads the parts of Noricum which lay imme-
diately south of the river. The Life of Saint Severinus . . . describes
their depredations ''; and again (p. 42 5), “ Parallel in some ways to
the position of Marcellinus and Aegidius is the beneficent theocracy
which Saint Severinus established about the same time in Noricum, a
masterless province unprotected by Rome, and harassed by the raids
of the Rugii from the north of the river.''
