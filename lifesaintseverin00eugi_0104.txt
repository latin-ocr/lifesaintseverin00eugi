ordered his body to be removed as a token; in order
that when the general transmigration oi the people
should take place, the company of brethren which he
had gathered might depart undivided, and, held
together by the common bond of his memory, might
endure as one holy society.

perfunctory. A casual examination of a volume of the Acta Sanc-
lorum taken at random— September, iii—reveals three cases, on
pages 58, 293, and 806.
