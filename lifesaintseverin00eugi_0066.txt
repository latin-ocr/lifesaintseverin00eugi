58 EUGIPPIUS

CHAPTER XIII

NEAR a town called Juvao,1 they went into the church
one summer day to celebrate the evening service, but
found no fire for lighting the lamps. Unable to elicit
a blaze in the usual way, by striking stones together,
they were so long delayed in striking iron and stone 2
that the time of the evening service was passing. But
the man of God kneeled on the ground and prayed
earnestly; and soon, in full view of three clerics who
were present at the time, the taper which Saint
Severinus held in his hand was lighted.³ By its light
the sacrifice of eventide was completed in the custo-
mary manner, and they returned thanks to God in all
things. Although he wished those who were present
at this miracle to keep the fact secret, as in the case of

¹ Juvao or Juvavum, now Salzburg.

auctoritas in hac re omnino quidquam valet.’' M. H. Morgan, “ De
Ignis eliciendi Modis apud Antiquos,’' in H arvard Studies in Classical
Philology, i (1890), p. 38.

³ A similar miracle is related of Alveus‚ or Alneus, a Gallie saint of
the sixth century. “ One night he arose for the early morning vigils,
and entered the church with the rest of the brethren. They found
that the lights which usually burned there were out. Saint Alveus
kneeled in prayer. The disciples searched for a light; but they could
find no fire. The hour was already late, and the disciples reminded the
saint of the lateness of the hour. Presently he rose from prayer, and
made the sign of the cross above the waxen taper. The taper was
kindled instantly through the excellence of God and the merits of the
saint, and gave a splendid light for all who were in the building.⁷’
