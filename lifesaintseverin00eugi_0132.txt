1 24 APPENDIX

Translation

Singing a song of praise unto the Lord, let us all celebrate
this festal day, on which kind Severinus entered the heights
of heaven.

What eloquent pen, what tuneful lyre can repeat all the
miracles which mighty Christ bestowed upon his excellent
zeal ?

Seer of renown and exceeding good omen, to whom, for
the salvation of the people then prostrate, God often made
known many things that were to corne,

With prophetie word he unravelled the snares of robbers
and the tricks of plunderers, and by supernal warnings
strongly defended the exhausted towns.

Giving sweet relief to the unfortunate, he banished the
horrid curse of famine, and set free from the foe many who
had been conquered by the fierce barbarians.

Great confessor, meek master, thou didst indeed give a
pattern to the monks, showing them how to mount to
heaven, following in the narrow path of temperance.

In thy sacred hands glittered the light from heaven3 and
the oil at thy drawing overflowed and increased like a foun-
tain.

He sympathized with all the destitute, and cherished
them3 he healed the sick‚ he relieved the suffering: every
one who approached received healing remedy.

And in the presence of the brethren thou didst pray over
Silvinus as he lay in the coffin‚ and, conquering death,
bring him back to the joys of life.

By the flame that burned the waxen tapers of the faithful
the holy father convicted the unbelievers; and our cold
hearts flame with the fire of God.
