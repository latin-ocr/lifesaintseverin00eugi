20 EUGIPPIUS

Even in the lifetime of Saint Severinus, I never
heard other particulars in regard to his native place
than those I have related. The testimonies concern-
ing his marvellous life accompany this letter, arranged
as a memoir‚ with a table of Chapters prefixed. Grant
my request, and let them gain greater fame through
thy editorial care.1 It remains to ask that thou cease
not to associate thy prayers with his for the pardon
of my sins.

Quelle, pp. 62—68, needs mention only by way of caution. Som—
merlad carries ingenuity to a great excess.

1 “ It is exceedingly doubtful whether the request was seriously
meant. Similar expressions are very common, which are no more
than polite phrases.’' Wilhelm wattenbach, Deutschlands Geschichts-
quellen im M ittelalter (6th ed„ Berlin, 1893—94)‚ i, p. 49.
