THE LIFE OF SEVERINUS 109

God, Processa by name, a citizen of Naples, who suf-
fered from a severe and troublesome sickness. In-
vited by the virtues of the holy corpse, she hastened
to meet it on the way3 and when she approached the
vehicle in which the venerable body was borne,
immediately she was free from sickness in all her
members.

Also at that time a blind man, Laudicius, was star-
tled when he heard the unexpected clamor of the peo-
ple singing psalms, and anxiously asked his household
what it was. When they replied that the body of a
certain Saint Severinus was passing, he was moved by
the spirit, and asked that he be led to the window3
from which one possessed oi sight could behold afar

172. There was, it would appear from Brunner's account, some
ecclesiastical as well as civil authority for the removal of the remains.
Nevertheless Dr. Galante considers that they were “ fraudolente-
mente rapitoci '’ (p. 41), and in his dissertation (pp. 41 f.) strongly
urges their return to Naples. ‘¹ Cives Fractenses,” he writes me
under date of March 20, 1914, “ non S. Severini, sed S. Sosii corpus
repetebant, et occasionem nacti expulsionis Monachorum e coenobio
et templo Severinianio‚ prope Archivium Magnum, corpora utriusque
simul quiescentia rapuerunt, et ad oppidum suum transtulerunt, ubi
nuncin maiori templo Fractensi quiescunt. Quamvis Monachi postea
redierint, haud curae fuit, sacra lipsana repetere. Superioribus annis
ego nullum non movi lapidem ut corpus S. Severini Neapoli restituere-
tur, sed frustra ; praecordia tantum sanguine intincta, et quatuor ossa
restituta sunt, quae nunc in templo S. Severini asservantur.’'

From 1807 to 1874 the bodies of Severinus and Sosius lay in a small
chapel near the parish church of F ratta Maggiore. They were then
removed into the church, to a new chapel, where the coffins, placed on
either side the altar, were covered with red velvet, and distinguished
by the gilt letters S. S. M. (Sanctus Sosius Martyr) and S. S. A.
(Sanctus Severinus Abbas). Brunner, St. Severin, pp. 179 f.
