LETTER OF EUGIPPIUS TO
PASCHASIUS

To the holy and venerable Deacon Paschasius, Eugip-
pius sends his salutation in Christ.

About two years ago, in the consulship of Impor-
tunus‚1 a letter of a noble layman, directed to a priest‚
was offered me to read. It contained the life of Bassus
a monk, who formerly dwelt in the monastery of the
mountain called Titas, above Ariminum, and later
died in the district of Lucania: a man very well
known to me and to many others. When Ι learned
that some were making copies of this letter, I began to
reflect‚ and also to declare to the clergy, that the great
miracles which the divine power had wrought through
Saint Severinus ought not to be hidden.

When the author of the letter knew of this, he
eagerly requested me to send him some memoranda
in regard to Saint Severinus‚ that he might write a

⁹ short account of the saint's life for the benefit of later

generations. In response to this offer, I prepared a
memoir‚ filled full with testimonies from the daily
narrations of the elder brethren, with which I was per-
fectly familiar. Yet Ι did this with great regret3 for
I deemed it umeasonable, that, while thou wert alive,
I should ask a layman to write a life of Severinus‚ It
